## The Model Defensive Patent License ##

### The Idea ###

The Defensive Patent License (DPL) is a new legal mechanism to protect innovators by networking patents into powerful, mutually-beneficial legal shields that are 100% committed to defending innovation -- no bullies, trolls, or other leeches allowed. 

It also helps prevent evildoers from patenting open technologies and pulling them out of the public domain. We think it's a great way for patents to be used for good, and not evil.

### Who Are You? ###

The DPL is the [brainchild of Professors Jason Shultz and Jennifer Urban at Berkeley Law](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttB_mjcIKcY). We're making this model license available to solicit for comments from the general public, and to foster a broader discussion about a new generation of approaches to patent licensing.
